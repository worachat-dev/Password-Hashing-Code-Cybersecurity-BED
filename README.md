# Password Authentication using Python

This project demonstrates a simple password authentication system using Python. The system securely hashes passwords and verifies user credentials against stored hashed passwords. It uses the PBKDF2 HMAC algorithm with SHA-256 for hashing and includes a unique salt for each password to enhance security.

## Features

- **Secure Password Storage**: Passwords are hashed with a unique salt using PBKDF2 HMAC with SHA-256.
- **Password Verification**: Verifies a provided password against stored hashed credentials.
- **Command Line Interface**: Accepts usernames and passwords via command-line input.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-authentication-python.git
cd password-authentication-python
```

### Running the Program

To run the program, execute the following command:

```bash
python authentication.py
```

You will be prompted to enter your username and password:

```
Enter Your Username: clcoding
Enter Your Password: ********
Verified
```

### Example Users

The system currently has two example users:

- **Username:** `clcoding`
  - **Password:** `976729`

- **Username:** `pythonclcoding`
  - **Password:** `2502`

These usernames and passwords are stored securely in the `database` dictionary within the code.

## Code Overview

- **`hash_password(password: str) -> tuple`**:
  - Hashes the provided password with a unique salt and returns the salt and hashed password.

- **`verify_password(stored_salt: bytes, stored_hash: bytes, provided_password: str) -> bool`**:
  - Verifies if the provided password matches the stored hashed password using the stored salt.

## Security Considerations

- **Salting and Hashing**: Each password is hashed with a unique salt to protect against precomputed hash attacks (rainbow tables).
- **PBKDF2 HMAC with SHA-256**: A strong and secure hashing algorithm with a high iteration count to slow down brute-force attacks.
