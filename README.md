# Password-Hashing-Code-Cybersecurity-BED
Password Authentication using Python This project demonstrates a simple password authentication system using Python. The system securely hashes passwords and verifies user credentials against stored hashed passwords. It uses the PBKDF2 HMAC algorithm with SHA-256 for hashing and includes a unique salt for each password to enhance security.
